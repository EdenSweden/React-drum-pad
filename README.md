## Welcome to my React Drum Pad.

Open this project's [Github Pages site](https://edensweden.github.io/react-drum-pad/) to view live.

Then simply tap the keys or click the buttons to make whatever cool beats you like! Switch drum kits to try out new sound combinations. Comes with volume control and a power button.

Have fun and get your groove on.

This project was built only using React functional components and hooks. Sound files were accessed via freeCodeCamp and are hosted online by Amazon AWS.
