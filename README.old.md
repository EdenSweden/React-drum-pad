# react-drum-pad
Drum pad project made for freeCodeCamp, but made in VS Code. Still in progress. Edits to be made later.

Personal note for changes needed:

1. Add volume functionality
2. Change audio preload to metadata for better performance?
3. Fix hover css when power is off
4. Fix async issues with sound interruption/re-tapping keys/power shutoff
5. Make accessible
6. Make adjustments for mobile responsiveness
7. Make any needed adjustments to pass freeCodeCamp tests
8. Finishing touches
