# react-drum-pad
Drum pad project made for freeCodeCamp, but made in VS Code. Still in progress.

Personal note for changes needed:

1. Make volume change dynamically as sound is produced. Maybe add event listener or fix changeVolume function
2. Fix issues with continued playback after power shutoff
3. Make sure keydown event isn't triggered if power is off
4. Make accessible
5. Make adjustments for mobile responsiveness
6. Clean up excessive comments/notes, unused vars, etc.
7. Make any needed adjustments to pass freeCodeCamp tests
8. Finishing touches
