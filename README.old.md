# react-drum-pad
Drum pad project made for freeCodeCamp, but made in VS Code. Still in progress.

Personal note for changes needed:

1. Make app accessible
2. Fix title icon
3. Make adjustments for mobile responsiveness
4. Ignore eslint for certain useEffect hooks?
5. Make any needed adjustments to pass freeCodeCamp tests
6. Finishing touches
