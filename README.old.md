# react-drum-pad
Drum pad project made for freeCodeCamp, but made in VS Code. Still in progress. Edits to be made later.

Personal note for changes needed:

3. Add power button functionality
4. Add volume functionality
5. Make adjustments for mobile responsiveness
6. Make any needed adjustments to pass freeCodeCamp tests
7. Finishing touches
