# react-drum-pad
Drum pad project made for freeCodeCamp, but made in VS Code. Still in progress.

Personal note for changes needed:

1. Make volume change dynamically as sound is produced. Maybe add event listener w/ useEffect or fix changeVolume function
2. Fix issues with continued playback after power shutoff
3. Fix display so it dynamically shows instrument names on keydown, etc.
4. Make app accessible
5. Make adjustments for mobile responsiveness
6. Clean up excessive comments/notes, unused vars, unused context files, etc.
7. Make any needed adjustments to pass freeCodeCamp tests
8. Finishing touches
