# react-drum-pad
Drum pad project made for freeCodeCamp, but made in VS Code. Still in progress.

Personal note for changes needed:

1. Fix display so it dynamically shows instrument names on keydown, etc.
2. Make app accessible
3. Make adjustments for mobile responsiveness
4. Clean up excessive comments/notes, unused vars, unused context files, etc.
5. Make any needed adjustments to pass freeCodeCamp tests
6. Finishing touches
