# react-drum-pad
Drum pad project made for freeCodeCamp, but made in VS Code. Still in progress. Edits to be made later.

Personal note for changes needed:

1. Make volume change dynamically as sound is produced
2. Change audio preload to metadata for better performance?
3. Fix hover css when power is off
4. Fix async issues with sound interruption/re-tapping keys/power shutoff
5. Make accessible
6. Make adjustments for mobile responsiveness
7. Make any needed adjustments to pass freeCodeCamp tests
8. Finishing touches
