# react-drum-pad
Drum pad project made for freeCodeCamp, but made in VS Code. Still in progress.

Personal note for changes needed:

1. Make volume change dynamically as sound is produced. Maybe add event listener? Maybe create new context for audio that can be accessed by power button & volume components
2. Fix issues with continued playback after power shutoff
3. Make accessible
4. Make adjustments for mobile responsiveness
5. Make any needed adjustments to pass freeCodeCamp tests
6. Finishing touches
7. Clean up excessive comments/notes
