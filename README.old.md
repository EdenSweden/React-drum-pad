# react-drum-pad
Drum pad project made for freeCodeCamp, but made in VS Code. Still in progress. Edits to be made later.

Personal note for changes needed:

1. Add power button functionality
2. Add volume functionality
3. Make accessible
5. Make adjustments for mobile responsiveness
6. Make any needed adjustments to pass freeCodeCamp tests
7. Finishing touches
